          <p class="textStyle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Santa Barbara Unified School District encourages parents of students with unique needs to partner with the district to enhance district-wide special education programs. In 2009, the district created the Staff Special Education Parent Advisory Committee (SSEPAC). The purpose of SSEPAC is to share information between the districtâ€™s special education department and parent representatives from each school site; to create a forum for parent representatives in order to provide input regarding special education policies and procedures; to provide an opportunity for parent representatives from each school site to collaborate; and to establish communication between parents, school sites, and district administration. The principals recommend two parents from each site to participate on SSEPAC. One parent is the representative and the other is an alternate. In addition to parent representatives, district special education leadership, principals, and board members participate in the meetings. Parents, teachers, and support staff are welcome to attend.
